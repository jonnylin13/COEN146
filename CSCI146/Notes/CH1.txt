4 sources of packet delay
d = d_processing + d_queueing + d_transmission_delay + d_propagation

transmission delay = packet length / link bandwidth
propagation delay = length of physical link / propagation speed (thru medium)

Caravan encounters two toll booths analogy
------------------
car speed is propagation speed (speed thru medium)
rate at which toll booth services cars (transmission rate)

R: link bandwidth (bps)
L: packet lenth (bits)
a: average packet arrival rate

aL: # of bits arriving per second
R: # of bits transisting per secondt

aL = R
NO queueing delay

Queueing delay is when a packet is received by the router, it must
queue because the transmission buffer is full and it cannot be sent 

Queue (aka buffer) has finite capacity
If you send a packet to a full queue, the packet is dropped
Lost packet may be retransmitted by protocol

Throughput: number of bits delivered over time 
* instantaneous: rate at given point in time
* average: rate over period of time

Network layering = breaking down complexity into protocol (series of steps)
Modularization keeps things easy to maintain
Sometimes cross-layer implementations can be difficult

Internet protocol stack (5 layers)
----------------------------------
application: supporting network applications (HTTP, FTP, SMTP)
transport: process-process data transfer (TCP, UDP)
network: routing datagrams from source to destination (IP, routing protocols)
* computer-computer (doesn't care about network, etc)
link: data transfer between neighboring networks (Ethernet, 802.111, PPP)
physical: bits "on the wire"
* bit transmission, bit travel, etc

application
-----------
* presentation: allow applications to interpret data
e.g. encryption, compression, machine-specific conventions
* session: synchronization, checkpointing, recovery of data exchange

application - message
transport - segment (transport header)
network - packet (with a packet header)
link - frame
