The Parable of the Prodigal Son
Luke 15

- Tax collectors and sinners criticize Jesus for receiving and feeding sinners
- Jesus gives lost sheep analogy, there is no reason to rejoice for 99 of the flock being there (doing what they are told, etc),
but there is all the reason to rejoice when a "lost sheep" is found and comes back to the herd
- Emphasizing the importance of helping others for the potential of guiding them towards Christianity?
- Man with two sons, one sells his inheritance to move, gets broke, and comes back
- Father rejoices while the other son is still bitter
- Tells his other son that it is a time to rejoice, because his son was dead and lost but now is found
