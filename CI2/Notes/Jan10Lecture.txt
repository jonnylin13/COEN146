ST. AUGUSTINE OF HIPPO: CONFESSIONS

- Born in Tagaste, North Africa in 354 CE
- Confessions from the beginning influenced Western civilization, shaped course of theology and philosophy
- We read Adam and Eve (original sin) through his lens
- We know more about Augustine than any other figure in antiquity
- First modern autobiography (lets us into the person's head)
- Other figures like Julius Caesar had written memoirs
- Writes not only what happened, but:

Why did I do that?
What was its effect on me?

- Confessions places emphasis on ones self
- Contrasts most of the works we read in the first half
- Augustine posits that God cares about every individual (enormous change from Ancient world)
- Augustine says to God, "You have made us for yourself"
- Expresses sentiment that our true home is not on Earth, but with God
- As he was dying, barbarian Vandals threatened the city of Hippo

Augustine addresses God while we listen in (to make the conversation feel candid)
- The confession is TO God but FOR us 
- Everything is recalled by a post-conversion Augustine (looking in retrospect)
- Allows reader to experience both struggle and confusion of being on the other side, and also 
writing in certainty and knowledge that could only come after conversion
- Represents the first attempt to give an account of childhood

In conclusion, something is radically wrong at the heart of human existence (original sin)

Two fundamental movements to note:
Aversio: "turning away from". Undergoes a variety of experiences which cumulatively
cause him to turn away from God
Conversio: "turning toward". Gradually being drawn back to God, all manifestations of God's grace.

Confessions is Aversio to Conversio
"You have made us for Yourself, and our hearts are restless until they rest in You."
