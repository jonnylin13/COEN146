Selections from the Qur'an

Islam means "submission" or "surrender" to the will of God
The Arabic root 's-l-m" [salaam] (like its Hebrew cognate 'sh-l-m' [shalom]) means 'peace'
The peace and social accord gained by submitting to the will of God
Muhammad (570-632), closely associted with final act of submission
Muhammad is the last and final Messenger of God, the 'seal of prophets'
Those who submit are known as Muslims (submit to the will of God through the writings of the prophet Muhammad)
Thos who 'fear God and obey His messengers'

For Christians, the ultimate revelation of God is the person of Jesus Christians
Christ Himself is the Word of God, spoken to and for the people of God

For Muslims, however, the Qur'an is itself the ultimate revelation of God
(Generally speaking, the Qur'an is taken literally) 
Every Qur'an here on Earth is a second generation copy of the divine Qur'an (in Heaven)
Muhammad is not the writer, but the conduit that channeled messengers from God
The original text (of the Book) is the tablet corresponding to the words of God

Like God, the Qur'an was not created but exists for all eternity - a complete and sufficient guide to our conduct on Earth
Claims to be God's final revelation to humanity and was sent by Him to complete and correct all prior revelations
It is greater than any prophet or prophecy

Desecrating the Qur'an is equivalent to desecrating the Eucharist [body and blood of Christ] (but even that, not the same violation)
Because the Qur'an is literally God's word, and is, like Him, miraculous and eternal, it cannot be translated
Qur'an acknowledges and completes all previous revelations, but also corrects and surpasses them
Jewish tradition of the Patriarchs is very important, as is the status given to Jesus as the greatest prophet before Muhammad
Muslims, Jews, and Christians are Abrahamic religions (Book of Genesis)

continual emphasis of merciful God, but also divine justice for non-believers
divine law (Sharia)
Qur'an is foundational document of Muslim societies
Sharia law (divine law) = Quranic injunctions + recorded statements and behavior of Muhammed (mimicking ritual behavior, hadith)
the most authoritative teaching after the Qur'an

In essense, sharia law is a moral law which human beings are to be judged in the hereafter
The actual judicial apparatus in an Islamic state

Fiqh, from the Arabic word for "understanding"
is the fallible human understanding of Sharia law as expressed in human, concrete rules
Muhammed recited from the angel Gabriel to his followers, Qur'an not put together until after his death
Consists of 114 suras, or chapters, of varying length
It is an oral work with a music and rhythm of its own that does not appear to best advantage on the printed page
