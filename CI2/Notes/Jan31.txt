The World Is Too Much With Us
by William Wordsworth

the world is overwhelming,
consuming and spending money, we are wasting potential and time
the products we adore are unnatural
we have sold our soul for cheap rewards (mythos at the cost of efficiency and consumerism)
we are out of tune with nature, it is no longer readily apparent in our lives
id rather be a pagan
seeing things that arent there in nature

1803 urban > country

Frankl everything is attributed to the desire for meaning
if you have meaning in your life, you can put up with any circumstance
if you are in hateful situation, they don't have the ability to change how you react
