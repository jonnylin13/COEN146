Multiple Access Links
- point-to-point
 * PPP for dial up
 * point-to-point link between host and Ethernet switch
Broadcast (shared medium)
- IEEE 802.11 WLAN or WiFi

Ideal MAC Protocol
given: broadcast channel of rate R bps
desiderata:
1) when one node wants to transmitted, sent at rate R
2) when multiple nodes N, sent at rate R/N
3) decentralized

MAC protocols:
- channel partitioning (dividing into time slots, frequency, code)
- random access
- taking turns or round robin

Channel partitioning MAC protocols: TDMA (time division multiple access)
Could also use FDMA (frequency division multiple access)
- Frequency bands are expensive, so bad when left unused

Random Access Protocols
- when a node has to send packet, will transmit at full channel data R
- no a priori coordination
- 2 or more transmitting nodes -> collision, so we must detect and recover
- slotted ALOHA, ALOHA, CSMA, CSMA/CD, CSMA/CA

slotted ALOHA (not perfect, not great performance, but the oldest)
- all frames same size
- time divided into equal size slots (time to send 1 frame)
- single active node can trasmit at full rate
- decentralized
- but lots of collisions, wasting slots, nodes might take too long to detect
collision before time to transmit next packet
- requires clock sync
- when a collision is detected, it will wait a RANDOM amount of time re-transmitting

suppose: N nodes with many frames to send, each transmits in slot with probability p
probability that one node will transmit successfully: p(1-p)^(N-1)
The limit of this probability as N goes to infinity is the max efficiency = 0.37
~60-70% of the time, collisions are happening

Pure (unslotted) ALOHA
- unslotted Aloha, simpler, no time sync
- when frame first arrives, transmit immediately
- collision probability increases (because all it takes is an overlap in transmissions)
- overlaps can now approach from the left, or the right
So.. probability in this case must consider left and right
Probability that one node will transmit successfully: p(1-p)^2(N-1)
when N -> inf, max efficiency -> 0.18 (not very good)

CSMA (carrier sense multiple access)
- listen before transmit
- if channel senses idle: transmit entire frame
- if channel senses busy: defer transmission
(basically don't interrupt others)
- collisions can still occur in the case that propagation delay interrupts two
node's communication (listen not recv'd quick enough)
- collision: entire packet transmission time wasted
  * distance and propagation delay play role in determining collision probability

CSMA/CD (collision detection)
- collisions detected within short time
- colliding transmissions aborted, to reduce wastage
- Ethernet CDMA/CD algorithm
 * Implements CSMA/CD, after aborting a transmission and sending jam signal,
 enters binary exponential backoff:  chooses K = {0, 1, 2, ..., 2^(m-1)} randomly
 depending on m collisions detected
 - efficiency approaches 1 as:
  * propagation time goes to 0
  * transmission time goes to infinity

 Round robin MAC protocols
 - try to find a best of both worlds (low waste, low collisions)
 POLLING (centralized)
 - master node "invites" slave nodes to transmit in turn
 TOKEN PASING
 - control token passed from one node to next
 - pass the token from node to node
