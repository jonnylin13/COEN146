How do we create 32 bit adders? (Figure 3.5 in Ch 3 Slides)
Starts from the least significant bit position and feeds left toward the most significant bit
(Chained full adders for each bit position, with cout as the next adder's cin)
But the full adders are acting functionally as half adders (?)

Figure 3.12 Adder/subtractor unit
Uses XOR to switch between adder and subtractor

XOR will negate the first input if the second input is 1, and act as buffer if 0
This allows us to use XOR to create one's complement, and then with that same
switch connect it as c0 or carry-in initial to create two's complement.


NMOS vs CMOS
parallel circuits vs series
