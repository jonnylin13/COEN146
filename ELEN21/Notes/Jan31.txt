Multiplication requires full adders

1's complement = a + a' = 2^n - 1
2's complement = a + a' = 2^n

A subtractor is just x0, x1, x2, x3 and y0, y1, y2, y3 added together
but y is inverted to make one's complement, and the LSB carryin is 1 to make 2's complement
Making x + 1's complement of y + 1 or x - y

A multiplexer can be any size 2^n
Takes many inputs and channels into a single output
A mux with 2 inputs A and B will have a selector S, if S is 0 then output will be A, else output will be B
